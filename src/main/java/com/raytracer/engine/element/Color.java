 * Each pixel on your computer monitor is a composite of three colors: red, green, and blue. If you 
 * take those three colors and mix them in different quantities, you get just about every other 
 * color you can imagine, from red, yellow, and green, to cyan, blue, and purple, and everything in 
 * between.
 * 
 * If you let red, green, and blue each be a value between 0 and 1 (with 0 meaning the color is 
 * entirely absent, and 1 meaning the color is fully present).
 * 
 * If all components are 1, you get white. If all components are 0, you get black.
 * In practice, youâ€™ll only use numbers between 0 and 1.
